- Triggered on pushes to main branch

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy manually

# Upload public/ directory to hosting provider
```

## Content Management

### Adding New Pages
```bash
# Create new page
hugo new page-name.md

# Create new post
hugo new posts/post-name.md
```

### Image Management
- Place images in `static/images/` directory
- Reference in content as `/images/filename.jpg`
- Use appropriate alt text for accessibility
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `petra-club-performance.jpg` instead of `IMG_1234.jpg`)

### Gallery System
- **Gallery Content**: `content/gallery.md` contains only introductory text
- **Gallery Template**: `layouts/gallery/single.html` contains hardcoded image grid
- **Gallery Images**: Located in `static/images/` with descriptive filenames
- **Adding Gallery Images**: 
  1. Copy images to `static/images/` with descriptive names
  2. Add new `<div class="gallery-item">` blocks to `layouts/gallery/single.html`
  3. Include proper alt text and captions for accessibility
  4. Gallery includes lightbox functionality for image viewing
- **Current Gallery Images**:
  - `petra-headshot.jpg` - Professional headshot
  - `petra-concert-lighting.jpg` - Concert with professional lighting

## Development Notes

- Site is primarily German language (`de-DE`)
- Uses custom layouts that extend Ananke theme
- Mobile-first responsive design
- SEO-optimized with proper meta tags
- Custom JavaScript for mobile menu functionality
- No external dependencies beyond Hugo and theme

## Important File Locations

### Source Images
- `pics/` - Original source images with descriptions in `pics/description.md`
- Use `pics/description.md` to understand image content before adding to gallery

### Configuration Files
- `hugo.toml` - Main site configuration
- `.github/workflows/hugo-deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions deployment
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Development container setup

### Custom Templates
- Gallery uses hardcoded HTML in `layouts/gallery/single.html`, not markdown
- Contact page has custom form styling in `layouts/contact/single.html`
- Homepage uses completely custom layout in `layouts/index.html`

## Best Practices

### Image Workflow
1. Review `pics/description.md` for image context
2. Copy images to `static/images/` with descriptive names
3. For gallery: Add to `layouts/gallery/single.html` template
4. For content: Reference as `/images/filename.jpg` in markdown

### Content Updates
- Keep content in German
- Maintain professional tone appropriate for musician services
- Update both content and corresponding templates when needed
